# Y-Box
Motivational Device for Office Workers

I've called this project the Y-Box. At first glance it's a desktop clock that stays accurate with NTP; I've done those plenty before.

My wife keeps having shitty WFH business meetings, and comes into my room afterwards to ask me "WHY am I even doing this?". One touch of the red button on top of the box reminds her how much money she's made this week so far, calculated on an normal working day. The amount is calculated to the second. Y? Because.

Currently the dollar amount displays without a Dollar sign, and with 4 decimal places - this is mainly to disguise the fact that it's a dollar amount, specifically if you're in a shared office environment so ther people don't know what that mysterious number is.
